Geometry Calculator
Description
This Python program is a simple geometry calculator that allows users to compute areas and perimeters (or circumferences) for different shapes interactively. The program includes calculations for triangles, rectangles, and circles, and provides a user-friendly menu for seamless interaction.

Features
Triangle:
Calculate the area using base and height.
Compute the perimeter using the lengths of three sides.
Rectangle:
Calculate the area and perimeter using length and width.
Circle:
Compute the area and circumference using radius.
Interactive Menu:
A looped menu for multiple calculations.
Option to exit when finished.
How to Use
Run the Program:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
Save the script as geometry_calculator.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the script:
python geometry_calculator.py
Choose an Option:

The program will display a menu.
Enter the corresponding number (1â€“5) based on the desired calculation:
Option 1: Area of a Triangle.
Option 2: Perimeter of a Triangle.
Option 3: Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle.
Option 4: Area and Circumference of a Circle.
Option 5: Exit the program.
Input Required Values:

Follow the prompts to input dimensions such as base, height, length, width, radius, or side lengths.
View Results:

The program will display the calculated result (e.g., area, perimeter, or circumference).
You can continue with additional calculations or exit the program.
Example Usage
Menu Example:
Choose the shape:
1. Triangle (Area using base and height)
2. Triangle (Perimeter using three sides)
3. Rectangle (Area and Perimeter)
4. Circle (Area and Circumference)
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1-5): 1
Enter the base of the triangle: 10
Enter the height of the triangle: 5
Area of the triangle: 25.0
